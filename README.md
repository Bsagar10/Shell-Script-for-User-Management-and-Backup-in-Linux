# Shell-Script-for-User-Management-and-Backup-in-Linux
This project involves managing user accounts and ensuring data backup are critical tasks in any Linux environment. This shell script combines both functionalities, allowing you to create, modify, and delete user accounts while also automating backups of specified directories.
Description:
User Management:
Create User Account: The script prompts you to input details (username, password, etc.) and creates a new user account.
Delete User Account: Specify the username, and the script removes the user account.
Modify User Account: Change user details such as password, home directory, or shell.
Backup Functionality:
The script compresses a specified directory using the tar command.
The compressed backup is stored in a designated backup folder.
You can customize the directories to back up according to your needs.
Crontab Scheduler Integration:
To automate backups, use the crontab scheduler.
Schedule the script to run at specific intervals (daily, weekly, etc.) to ensure regular backups.
Security Considerations:
Ensure that the script runs with appropriate permissions (usually as root or with sudo).
Store backups securely (preferably in remote repositories) to prevent data loss.
